- A Discord bot token (can be obtained from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- A `.env` file containing the following environment variables:
  - `TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
  - `CHANNEL` - The ID of the channel where the bot should send the redeemed codes
